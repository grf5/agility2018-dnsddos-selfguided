Base BIG-IP Configuration
-------------------------

In this lab, the VE has been configured with the basic system settings
and the VLAN/self-IP configurations required for the BIG-IP to
communicate and pass traffic on the network. We’ll now need to configure
the BIG-IP to listen for traffic and pass it to the back end server.

1.  Launch the Firefox shortcut titled **Launch BIG-IP Web UI** on the
    desktop of your lab jump server. The credentials for the BIG-IP are
    conveniently displayed in the login banner. Just in case: **admin /
    401elliottW!**

2.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Nodes** and create a new node with
    the following settings, leaving unspecified fields at their default
    value:

    a. Name: lab-server-10.10.0.50

    b. | Address: 10.10.0.50
       | |image4|

3.  Click **Finished** to add the new node.

4.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Pools** and create a new pool with
    the following settings, leaving unspecified attributes at their
    default value:

    a. Name: lab-server-pool

    b. Health Monitors: gateway\_icmp

    c. New Members: Node List

       i.   Address: lab-server-10.10.0.50

       ii.  Service Port: \* (All Ports)

       iii. | Click **Add** to add the new member to the member list.
            | |image5|

5.  Click **Finished** to create the new pool.

6.  Because the attack server will be sending a huge amount of traffic,
    we’ll need a fairly large SNAT pool. Navigate to **Local Traffic** >
    **Address Translation** > **SNAT Pool List** and create a new SNAT
    pool with the following attributes:

    a. Name: inside\_snat\_pool

    b. Member List: 10.10.0.125, 10.10.0.126, 10.10.0.127, 10.10.0.128,
       10.10.0.129, 10.10.0.130 |image6|

7.  Click **Finished** to commit your changes.

8.  Navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers** and create a new
    virtual server with the following settings, leaving unspecified
    fields at their default value:

    a. Name: udp\_dns\_VS

    b. Destination Address/Mask: 10.20.0.10

    c. Service Port: 53

    d. Protocol: UDP

    e. Source Address Translation: SNAT

    f. SNAT Pool: inside\_snat\_pool

    g. | Default Pool: lab-server-pool
       | |image7|

9.  Click **Finished**.

10. We’ll now test the new DNS virtual server. SSH into the attack host
    by clicking the “Attack Host (Ubuntu)” icon on the jump host
    desktop.

11. Issue the dig @10.20.0.10
    `www.example.com <http://www.example.com>`__ +short command on the
    BASH CLI of the attack host. You should see output similar to:
    |image8|\ This verifies that DNS traffic is passing through the
    BIG-IP.

12. Return to the BIG-IP and navigate to **Local Traffic** > **Virtual
    Servers** and create a new virtual server with the following
    settings, leaving unspecified fields at their default value:

    a. Name: other\_protocols\_VS

    b. Destination Address/Mask: 10.20.0.10

    c. Service Port: \* (All Ports)

    d. Protocol: \* All Protocols

    e. Any IP Profile: ipother

    f. Source Address Translation: SNAT

    g. SNAT Pool: inside\_snat\_pool

    h. Default Pool: lab-server-pool |image9|

13. Return to the Attack Host SSH session and attempt to SSH to the
    server using SSH 10.20.0.10. Simply verify that you are prompted for
    credentials and press CTRL+C to cancel the session. This verifies
    that non-DNS traffic is now flowing through the BIG-IP.
