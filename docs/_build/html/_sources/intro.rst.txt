DDoS and DNS Protocol Attacks Lab Overview
==========================================

About detecting and protecting against DoS, DDoS, and DNS protocol attacks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attackers can target the BIG-IP® system in a number of ways. The BIG-IP system addresses several possible DoS, DDoS, and DNS attack routes. These DoS attack prevention methods are available when theBIG-IP® Advanced Firewall Manager™ is licensed and provisioned.

DoS and DDoS attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks attempt to render a machine or network resource unavailable to users. DoS attacks involve the efforts of one or more sources to disrupt the services of one or more hosts connected to the Internet.

With Advanced Firewall Manager, you can configure the system to automatically track traffic and CPU usage patterns over time and adapt automatically to possible DoS attacks across a range of DoS vectors. You can initiate DoS detection for the whole system, and in profiles that are associated with specific virtual servers. Configure responses to system-level DoS attack vectors in the DoS Device Configuration.

Automatic threshold configuration is available for a range of non-error packet types on the AFM system. Use automatic thresholds to adapt responses to DoS attack vectors based on the traffic history on the system.

With AFM, you can also configure manual responses to DoS vectors. For non-error packets, you can specify absolute packet-per-second limits for attack detection (reporting and logging), percentage increase thresholds for detection, and absolute rate limits on a wide variety of packets that attackers can leverage as attack vectors.

You can also enable Bad Actor detection on a per-vector basis to identify IP addresses that engage in attacks where one IP address is targeting many destinations; the system can automatically blacklist Bad Actor IP addresses with specific thresholds and time limits. In addition, you can use Attacked Destination Detection to determine IP addresses that are being attacked from many sources (many to one attacks). The attacked addresses are added to a list and packets are rate limited to that attacked address.

DNS flood (or DoS) attacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Denial-of-service (DoS) or flood attacks attempt to overwhelm a system by sending thousands of requests that are either malformed or simply attempt to overwhelm a system using a particular DNS query type or protocol extension, or a particular SIP request type. The BIG-IP system allows you to track such attacks, using the DoS Protection profile.

Malformed DNS packets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Malformed DNS packets can be used to consume processing power on the BIG-IP system, ultimately causing slowdowns like a DNS flood. The BIG-IP system drops malformed DNS packets, and allows you to configure how you track such attacks. This configuration is set in the DoS Protection profile.

Protocol exploits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attackers can send DNS requests using unusual DNS query types or OpCodes. The BIG-IP system can be configured to allow or deny certain DNS query types, and to deny specific DNS OpCodes. When you configure the system to deny such protocol exploits, the system tracks these events as attacks. This configuration is set in the DNS Security profile.

**NOTE:** The BIG-IP is capable of mitigating other protocol-specific attacks, for example, HTTP, SIP, SSH and others. Those protocols are out of the scope of this document and lab.

About profiles for DoS and protocol service attacks
---------------------------------------------------

On the BIG-IP® system, you can use different types of profiles to detect and protect against system DoS attacks, to rate limit possible attacks, and to automatically blacklist IP addresses when identified as Bad Actors. You can configure settings for specific protocol attacks for DNS, and other network attacks.

DoS Protection profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the DoS Protection profile, you can configure settings for DoS protection that you can apply to a virtual server, to protect a specific application or server. You can configure the DoS profile to provide specific attack prevention at a more granular level than the Device DoS profile. In a DoS Profile, you can:

-  Configure automatic thresholds for each profile, and for specific DoS
   vectors, to allow the system to adjust the configuration for DoS
   attack detection automatically over time.

-  Define a source IP address whitelist, to allow legitimate addresses
   to pass through the DoS protection checks.

-  Define settings for DNS protocol error detection, which allows you to
   configure a percentage rate increase over time and a
   packets-per-second threshold to trigger logging, as well as a hard
   rate limit on DNS protocol error packets.

-  Define packet-per-second detection-limit, percentage rate increases,
   and packet-per-second rate limiting for DNS record types.

-  Define settings for SIP protocol error detection, which allows you to
   configure a percentage rate increase over time and a
   packets-per-second threshold to trigger logging, as well as a hard
   rate limit on SIP protocol error packets.

-  Define specific packet-per-second rate increases, percentage rate
   increases, and packet-per-second rate limiting for SIP request
   methods.

-  Configure identification, rate limiting, and automatic blacklisting
   of Bad Actors for supported attack vectors, according to various
   detection criteria.

-  Offload blacklisting of Bad Actor IP addresses to edge routers using
   BGP.

-  Configure identification, rate limiting, and classification of
   attacked destinations.


Lab Overview
------------

This lab covers DDoS mitigation, DNS DoS mitigations as well as DNS query filtering.


Lab Hosts
---------

**NOTE:** You do not need to memorize the following IPs. Login methods/credentials for
each resource will be provided in the lab instructions.

The following table lists host information for the lab components:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 40 40
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1

    * - **Component**
      - **Description**
      - **VLAN/IP Address(es)**
    * - DNS Server
      - a virtual server running Ubuntu 17.10 with BIND9 installed and pre-configured to act as an attack target for network and DNS attacks
      - - **Inside:** 10.10.0.50
    * - Attack Host
      - a virtual server running Ubuntu 17.10 with open-source, highly available attack tools installed to simulate DDoS/DoS and DNS DoS attacks
      - - **Outside:** 10.20.0.50
    * - BIG-IP
      - a single F5 BIG-IP VE running 13.1.0.1 with LTM, AFM and AVR provisioned
      - - **Management:** 192.168.1.100
        - **Inside:** 10.10.0.11
        - **Outside:** 10.20.0.11
    * - Jump Host
      - a Windows jump host, which will simulate an engineer’s workstation for accessing the various other components in the lab
      - - **Management:** 192.168.1.200

.. CAUTION:: The lab environment has limited resources, thus you will see very low values for attack detection and mitigation thresholds. There may be a delay between an action/trigger and the logs being shown in the UI. Monitoring the BIG-IP LTM logs in the SSH session real-time is helpful for immediate validation. If the UI is not showing logs, re-run the last attack/test and wait for a few minutes before refreshing the logging/reporting screen.**

Lab Pre-configuration
---------------------

For the lab today, the following items have been completed for you:

-  basic VM NIC configuration

-  Victim host BIND9 installation and configuration

-  Attack tool installations on the attack host

-  basic management/VLAN/self-IP configuration on the BIG-IP

-  AFM, LTM and AVR provisioning on the VE

-  admin/root credentials on VMs and VE configured

Lab Connectivity
----------------

While working in the lab, you’ll likely find it easiest to have the
BIG-IP web UI open in a browser and an SSH session open to the BIG-IP,
the attack host and the victim server. You will be switching between
sessions frequently. On the BIG-IP SSH session, having 'tail -f
/var/log/ltm' running from the BASH prompt helps immensely as you can see attack 
detection log messages in real-time.

To connect to the lab:

1. Navigate to the training portal URL given to you by the instructor.

2. You will be presented with the login page. Login using the
     credentials provided.

4. You will see a list of the hosts in your environment. For best results, RDP to the DNS name of the Jumpbox. If RDP is not working, you can click on the console of the Jumpbox.

|image3|

The credentials for the Jumpbox are **student / 401elliottW!**

**You may now begin the lab.**

There is a text file on the desktop of the jump host with all of the CLI
commands used in the lab for cut/paste use.

Ensure Correct System Time 
---------------------------

The jump host system clock has a tendency to skew. Before we get
started, let’s force an NTP sync.

1. Right-click on the system clock in the Windows taskbar.

2. Click **Adjust date/time**.

3. Select the **Internet Time** tab.

4. Click the **Change settings…** button.

5. Click **Update now** until you see a message that the clock was
   successfully synchronized.

6. Click **OK**.

7. Click **OK**.
